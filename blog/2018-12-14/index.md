## Detailed Thoughts

Overall this process has been challenging due to the nature of working with a web team. I've previously only worked on iOS projects as a solo developer, so there was an adjustment period for making sure I was communicating fully. That being said, the most difficult challenge was communication between the two sides. Additionally, we used some new tech which had a bit of a ramp up period.


## Weekly Summary

This week we spent time implementing new features and bug fixes. The new features were pretty necessary to provide a better user experience. We added in the ability to share the article from Safari to our application so they don't have to leave their browser and manually copy paste the link. This being one of the final weeks, we had a lot of bug fixes and polish to make sure it was ready for presentation.

We were capable of getting a users data from the Django backend and display it appropriately. Now the users can view their information offline by taking advantage of Core Data and caching.
