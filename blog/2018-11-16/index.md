## Detailed Thoughts

This week we created some example JSON for our application to consume and use. This is in preparation for the upcoming JSON that the Django server will generate. This JSON is consumed into both the collection view and the detail view. There were some changes to the appearance of both the main "Saved" view and the secondary "detail" view for articles.

## Weekly Summary
This week the team ran into some issues connecting the frontend to the backend. Our team is taking on new technology (Django) so there is a learning process involved. This has made us to work together more closely to ensure less mistakes are made and it is working out well. 

I was reluctant to jump into the Django app since my main focus is iOS but I did it anyways and was surprised at how much I could contribute. This felt risky as I thought I would break everything but the risk paid off in many ways for the team and the project overall as I was able to make impactful contributions.
